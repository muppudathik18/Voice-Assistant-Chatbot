CLASSIFY_EXTRACT_PROMPT = """
You are an intelligent assistant that classifies user intent and extracts relevant details.
Classify the user's intent into one of three categories (return only the single category):
    - RAG (requests for factual dealership info like specials, inventory, finance, EV incentives),
    - APPOINTMENT (booking appointment, rescheduling, checking availability),
    - CHAT (casual conversation, greetings, small talk).

If the intent is APPOINTMENT, also extract details into a JSON object.
The JSON object should have the following fields:
- "action": "book" | "check_availability" | null (if not specified)
- "appointment_type": "sales" | "service" | null (if not specified)
- "customer_name": <get from the query, if not present, ask the name>
- "time_preference": "tomorrow at 10 AM" | "next Tuesday" | null (natural language time mentioned in the query)
- "duration_minutes": 30 | 60 | null (default to 30 if not specified in the query)
- "agent_name": "Sarah Johnson" | null (if a specific agent is mentioned in the query, fill that)

Your response should be in the format:
CATEGORY
<JSON_DETAILS> (only if CATEGORY is APPOINTMENT)

Example 1:
User query: What are your current lease specials?
RAG

Example 2:
User query: I want to book a service appointment for tomorrow at 10 AM for John.
APPOINTMENT
{"action": "book", "appointment_type": "service", "customer_name": "Aathi", "time_preference": "tomorrow at 10 AM", "duration_minutes": null, "agent_name": null}

Example 3:
User query: Can I schedule a test drive with Mike next week?
APPOINTMENT
{"action": "book", "appointment_type": "sales", "customer_name": null, "time_preference": "next week", "duration_minutes": null, "agent_name": "Mike"}

REPHRASE_QUERY_PROMPT = """
You are an excellent query rewriter. Your task is to rewrite the user's follow-up into a standalone question by gathering all the necessary information from the previous context. 

There are broadly two types of questions,
    - One related to knowledge based like queries that need to be answered from documents
    - One related to appointment. So here it may have the necessary details like customer name, sales agent name, agent type, time preference etc information in the previous context. So get those details from history and rephrase the current query in a way it has all the necessary details without missing it from the context.

Eg: [1 session conversation]
User Question 1: Book an appointment
Rephrased query 1: can you book an appointment?
Answer 1 in context: could you please say your name?

User Question 2: Joe
Rephrased query 2: can you book an appointment for Joe?
Answer 2 in context: could you please say the appointment type + [Answer 1 in context]

User Question 3: sales
Rephrased query 3: can you book a sales appointment for Joe?
Answer 3 in context: could you please give time? + [Answer 1 and 2 in context]
